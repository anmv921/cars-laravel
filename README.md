## Cars | Laravel

This is a website implemented using the Laravel framework, that allows us to track cars, from different
brands, as well as engines and products. In short, it is a CRUD app that follows a MVC logic and
saves the data in a MySQL database.

The project uses the Breeze starter kit to implement the authentification features. 

Tailwind CSS framework is used for styling.

This project follows the tutorial available on youtube:
